# Python-API-challenge

An Open Weather and Google API key are required. These should be saved to a file called "api_keys.py" in the "Code" folder.

## Part I

Part one of this project uses the OpenWeather API to collect weather data for over 500 cities at random. This data is stored to a CSV for part two of the project. 

With the collected data, a linear regession was performed between several weather patterns and the Latitude, such as, temperature vs. latitude.

## Part II

Part two of this project uses the previously collected data and the Google Places API. Using the data from the previous section, a heatmap was generated based of humidity levels. The final task was to use the Google Places API to search for hotels located in the randomly generated cities and add a marker on top of the heatmap for each hotel.
